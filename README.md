**Web Design Semester Project**

This is a semester project for our **Web Design** course. My teammate and I worked together to create a **prototype** and the first page of a website.  

- **My teammate** made an interactive prototype.  
- **I** built the website and wrote the documentation.  

This project was a great **simulation** for me to practice building a website from a prototype.  

The website was created using the **Mobile-first approach**. It includes:  

- **CSS variables** for better styling management  
- **Grid layout** and **Flexbox** for structure  
- **Accessibility** following at least **WCAG Level AA**  

This project helped me improve my front-end development skills and understand the importance of accessibility in web design.
